My codes and datasets are available in https://github.com/ting-yu-kang/Supervised-Learning.git

1. There are five python files in Algorithms/, each one is for one machine learning algorithm.
2. To execute the codes, please go the the Google Colaboratory(https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Create a new Python3 notebook.
4. Paste the code onto the pad.
5. To train and test the two data set, uncomment the part of the corresponding lines in the bottom of the code.
6. Press the run bottom on the upper left.
7. You can See the training result and the graphs below.

P.S. The two datasets are attached the folder(Datasets/) for reference, but in the code, I fetch the datasets through urls instead.
